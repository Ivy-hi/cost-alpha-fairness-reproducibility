# cost-alpha-fairness-reproducibility
This repository contains the code required to reproduce the numerical results and figures presented in the manuscript "The Cost α-Fairness Model: A Unified Framework for Fairness in Cost Allocation".
## Contents
- `New_traffic_signal.m`: Numerical simulation and optimization scripts.
## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later

## Usage
1. Run `New_traffic_signal.m` to generate numerical results.
## Notes
All results are deterministically generated from the proposed model.
